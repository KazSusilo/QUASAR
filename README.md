## Summary
QUASAR is a 2D Endless Beat'Em Up Game where players are stranded in space with nothing but the sabers they hold. Defying death, they choose to continue fighting, striking down anything that gets in the way of their new-found goal. One wrong move, and it's all over...

## Run-Instructions
QUASAR\QUASAR 1.01\bin\Debug\QUASAR.exe

## Objective 
Players take their last stand to destroy any incoming comets and achieve a high-score!

## How to Play
### Player & Comets
Players are positioned at the bottom centre of the screen alongside their sabers. When the game starts, multiple comets will approach the player from various directions including the left, top left, top, top right, and right side of the screen.

### Attacking & Controls
Once comets are in reach of the player's attack radius, use attacks in order to fend off incoming projectiles.

Attacks are controlled using the AQWED Keys in correspondance to where the comet approaches.

Points are awarded for every comet striken down and can be located at the bottom of the screen. However, one wrong move, and the game ends!
